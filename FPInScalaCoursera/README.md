FunctionalProgrammingInScala
============================

Homework for Functional Programming in Scala course taught
by Marton Odersky.  The actual class is in Scala, but I thought
it would be interesting to also do the problems in Haskell;
posting the Scala solutions would violate the Coursera terms of
service.
